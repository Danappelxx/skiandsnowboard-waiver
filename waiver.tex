\maketitle

This is a legally binding Release, Waiver, Discharge and Covenant Not to Sue
(collectively, ``Release''), made voluntarily by me, the undersigned releasor,
on my own behalf, and on behalf of my heirs, executors, administrators, legal
representatives and assigns (hereinafter collectively, ``Releasor,'' ``I'' or
``me'', which terms shall also include Releasor's parents or guardian, if
Releasor is under 18 years of age) to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, including all volunteers of the MIT Outing Club (``MITOC''), and
M.I.T. Outing Club, Inc. (collectively ``MIT'').

As the undersigned Releasor, I fully recognize that there are dangers and risks
to which I may be exposed by participating in MITOC activities, including,
without limitation, danger from rock-fall, sudden changes in weather, falls on
steep terrain, failure of equipment, getting lost, and other risks and hazards
arising from camping (including camping in cabins owned by M.I.T. Outing Club,
Inc.), hiking, rock and ice climbing, mountaineering, wilderness travel,
kayaking, canoeing, skiing, biking, surfing, and transportation to/from such
activities (the ``MITOC Activities''). As the undersigned Releasor, I
understand that MIT does not require me to participate in the MITOC Activities,
but I want to do so despite the possible dangers and risks and despite this
Release. I acknowledge that if I participate in any water-related activities, I
know how to swim or will wear a life vest. With informed consent, and for
valuable consideration received, including assistance provided by MIT, as the
undersigned Releasor, I agree to assume and take on myself all of the risks and
responsibilities in any way arising from or associated with the MITOC
Activities, and I release MIT and all of its affiliates, divisions, departments
and other units, committees and groups, and its and their respective governing
boards, officers, directors, principals, trustees, legal representatives,
members, owners, employees, volunteers, agents, administrators, assigns, and
contractors (collectively ``Releasees''), from any and all claims, demands,
suits, judgments, damages, actions and liabilities of every name and nature
whatsoever, whenever occurring, whether known or unknown, contingent or fixed,
at law or in equity, that I may suffer at any time arising from or in
connection with the MITOC Activities, including any injury or harm to me, my
death, or damage to my property, whether caused by or arising from the
negligence of MIT (collectively ``Liabilities''), and I agree to defend,
indemnify, and save Releasees harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities.

As the undersigned Releasor, I recognize that this Release means I am giving
up, among other things, all rights to sue Releasees for injuries, damages or
losses I may incur. I also understand that this Release binds my heirs,
executors, administrators, legal representatives and assigns, as well as
myself. I also affirm that I have adequate medical or health insurance to cover
any medical assistance I may require.

I agree that this Release shall be governed for all purposes by Massachusetts
law, without regard to such law on choice of law.

\textbf{I have read this entire Release. I fully understand the entire Release
    and acknowledge that I have had the opportunity to review this Release with
    an attorney of my choosing if I so desire, and I agree to be legally bound
    by the Release.}
